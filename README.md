# Human-Skeletal-Form
Deep learning models and code for quality control (QC) and human pose estimation (HPE). Both QC and HPE heavily utilize transfer learning and are built upon FastAIV2 and HRNet (deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch) respectively. Training images were chosen by hand from UKB bulk download FID 20158. Examples of how to build your own training models are included as well as code for deployment on existing datasets. 

## Deep learning based quality-control
Download models from Box Drive: https://utexas.box.com/s/n1aqy4k8a0ms6li3kh40k9n03zbz8aw7

Apply to own dataset by following file structure in Jupyter Notebooks


## Human Pose Estimation
Follow basic install instructions from https://github.com/leoxiaobin/deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch

Download pre-trained pose_coco models as instructed

Download additional models from Box Drive: https://utexas.box.com/s/n1aqy4k8a0ms6li3kh40k9n03zbz8aw7

Apply to own dataset with .yaml files in this github
